# heroku

Technologies Used:
Used Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Used Mongoose, which provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.

Used Express, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Used EJS, which is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

Used Heroku, which is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages.

Used MongoDB Atlas, which is the global cloud database service for modern applications.

Used MongoDB, which is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.

Used VSCode, a free-source code-editor made by Microsoft.


Approach taken:
I started first by organizing planning out my site then organizing my routes. Then, I started to write my routes and build my EJS pages. I built a seed route and seeded my data. I added some styling so I'd have something to look at. Then, I added a buy button and began to try to figure out my cart page.

Unsolved problems:
I never figured out how to make a cart page, or how to upload new images.

User Stories:
A user should be able to view succulents, add a new succulent, edit succulents, and "buy" a succulent such that its quantity will decrease by 1.

Notes:
See unsolved problems. Also, color filter on index page not showing up on mobile. No clue why.
